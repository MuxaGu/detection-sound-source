# detection-sound-source

The program is designed to calculate the direction to a sound source in water using a four-chanel record. The geometry of the array must follow the diagram below. In the 'sounddim20.m' program, you must specify a fragment of time for analysis. The variable 'ttt' denotes the beginning of the fragment in seconds (from start of file), the variable 'dt' denotes the duration of the fragment. The variable 'band' defines the upper and lower frequency boundaries for analysis in Hz. After executing the script, the program calculates the direction for each pair of hydrophones at each moment of time, records the result in the appropriate variables, and builds graphs: a spectrogram, and three graphs of the direction for the first three pairs of hydrophones. By these graphs, it is possible to determine the exact direction in any parts of the selected fragment. After that, you can run the 'getscan.m' program, which calculates the exact direction to the source in two angular coordinates, vertical and horizontal. To do this, you need to specify the time for analysis within the fragment. The 't1i' variable indicates the start time for analysis within the fragment in seconds, 't2i' the end time. In this case, all values in this interval are averaged. Therefore, here you should select the values corresponding to only one sound source. As a result, the program maps the probability distribution of the sound source, on which the maximum value corresponds to the most posible direction to the sound source.
